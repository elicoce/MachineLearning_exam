## Challenges - Introduction to Machine Learning
This folder contains the 4 challenges assigned in the *Introduction to Machine Learning* course. 
Each challenge focuses on different core concepts of machine learning, and serves as preparatory work for the final exam project.

Each challenge includes its own notebook with code and a brief report of its contents.
## Overview

| Challenge     | Main Topics                                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `challenge_0` | Binary classification, logistic regression, Ridge & Lasso regularization     |
| `challenge_1` | Supervised vs. unsupervised learning: clustering and classification methods |
| `challenge_2` | Kernel Ridge Regression and Kernel PCA (custom implementation)              |
| `challenge_3` | Deep learning models applied to the KMNIST dataset (PyTorch)                |

## Tools and libraries
All challenge are implemented in Python 3.11 using libraries like scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, PyTorch.
